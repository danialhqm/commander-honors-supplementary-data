# commander-honors-supplementary-data
Full supplementary data for honours dissertation "Exploring the structure and function of the Commander complex across eukaryotes".
A guide to navigating the folders is seen below. 

# LEGEND
1) AA sequences
- Contains all amino acid sequences in FASTA format. All human sequences were retrieved from UniProt via accession ID. Sequences from other species were retrieved via phmmer.

2) Alphafold3 Outputs
- This folder contains .cif files and other outputs from Alphafold3. PyMol is recommended for visualisation.
# At time of writing, this folder is incomplete, due to issues uploading larger files. This repository is currently missing AF3 outputs for CCDC22, CCDC93, VPS29, VPS26C, VPS35L, subcomplex and full complex. 

3) FoldMason JSON
- This folder contains JSON files for FoldMason multiple structural alignment. Files can be imported and viewed at https://search.foldseek.com/foldmason

4) Multiple sequence alignment
- This folder contains all MUSCLE multiple sequence alignments in fasta and subsequently exported via PNG. Jalview is recommended for visualisation.

5) Phylogenetic Trees
- This folder contains phylogenetic trees in Newick format in a single text file, viewable in iTol or other relevant software.
